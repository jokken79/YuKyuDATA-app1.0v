# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides the creation of beautiful, distinctive, and production-ready frontend interfaces.

## Core Principles

### 1. Design Thinking First
Before writing code, commit to a bold aesthetic direction:
- Understand the purpose and audience
- Select a distinct tone (minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, brutalist, etc.)
- Identify what makes this design unforgettable

**Critical Guideline**: "Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity."

### 2. Typography Excellence
- **DO**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **AVOID**: Generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto, Helvetica (unless intentionally brutal)
- **USE**: Google Fonts with character, web-safe combinations, custom font pairings
- Consider font weight variations, letter spacing, and hierarchy

### 3. Color & Theme Mastery
- Create cohesive palettes with dominant colors and sharp accents
- Avoid clichéd schemes (especially purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Use color psychology intentionally
- Consider dark mode from the start

### 4. Motion & Animation
- CSS animations with high-impact moments
- Scroll-triggered effects for engagement
- Micro-interactions that delight
- Performance-conscious implementation

### 5. Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts with asymmetry
- Strategic negative space
- Grid systems that break conventions thoughtfully
- Responsive design that adapts intelligently

### 6. Visual Details
- Atmosphere-building through gradients and textures
- Decorative elements with purpose
- Glassmorphism, neumorphism, or other modern effects (when appropriate)
- Attention to shadows, borders, and depth

## What to Avoid (AI Slop)

**Generic Patterns to Eliminate**:
- ❌ Default fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- ❌ Purple gradients over white backgrounds
- ❌ Predictable card layouts without character
- ❌ Minimal animations or no animations
- ❌ Cookie-cutter patterns lacking context-specific character
- ❌ Copy-paste component libraries without customization

## Implementation Guidelines

**Match code complexity to aesthetic vision**:
- **Maximalist designs**: Require elaborate animations, rich interactions
- **Minimalist designs**: Demand precision in spacing, typography, and restraint

**Technology Stack**:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS for lightweight projects
- React + Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- shadcn/ui components (customized, not default)
- GSAP for advanced animations
- Framer Motion for React animations

## Design Checklist

Before considering a design complete, verify:

✅ **Typography**: Custom fonts loaded, hierarchy clear, readability excellent
✅ **Color**: Cohesive palette, intentional contrasts, accessibility (WCAG AA)
✅ **Layout**: Responsive, interesting composition, appropriate white space
✅ **Motion**: Meaningful animations, no jank, respects prefers-reduced-motion
✅ **Details**: Polish on hover states, focus states, loading states
✅ **Performance**: Fast initial load, optimized assets, no layout shift
✅ **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

## Examples of Great Design

**Minimal & Refined**:
- Clean typography hierarchies
- Generous white space
- Subtle micro-interactions
- Monochromatic or limited palettes

**Maximal & Bold**:
- Vibrant color explosions
- Complex layered animations
- Rich textures and patterns
- Distinctive custom illustrations

**Brutalist & Raw**:
- Intentionally harsh type
- Unconventional layouts
- High contrast
- Technical aesthetic

## Working with This Skill

When creating interfaces:

1. **Ask about the vision**: What feeling should this evoke?
2. **Propose a direction**: Suggest 2-3 distinct aesthetic approaches
3. **Execute with precision**: Every detail should support the vision
4. **Iterate based on feedback**: Refine towards the intended aesthetic

Remember: **Distinctive > Generic, Intentional > Default, Memorable > Safe**
